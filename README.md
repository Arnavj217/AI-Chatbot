This project focuses on developing an AI-based chatbot using Python that can simulate human-like conversations. 
The chatbot is designed to understand user queries and respond appropriately using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
It uses libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, or transformer-based models like GPT for text processing and response generation. 
The chatbot can be trained on custom datasets (e.g., FAQs, product information, or general conversation data) to improve accuracy and relevance. 
The application also includes a simple GUI (using Tkinter or a web interface using Flask) where users can interact with the bot. 
The system supports continuous learning, allowing it to improve over time based onuser interactions.
